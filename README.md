# Shopify + NextJS 13 app dir

Boilerplate for setting up a headless Shopify with NextJS.

- React 18 with Suspense and React Server Components
- Next.js 13 app directory
- Framer Motion for animations
- Tailwind CSS with `clsx` and `tailwind-merge` for dynamic classes
- TypeScript (no-brainer)
- PNPM package manager
- ESLint and Prettier
- Shopify Storefront API
- GraphQL

## TODO

- [ ] Add `react-query` for data fetching
